<h2>Greetings! My name is Chan Seung Lee, but I go by Jason to those who prefer to call me that way!</h2>
<p>My OSU email address is leechans@oregonstate.edu</p>

<ul>
  <li>I've transferred from LCC to OSU's Computer Science program as a Junior.</li>
  <li>While web development hasn't exactly been my forte in my journey of coding, my most interesting recollection
    in the field is my experience in helping design our lab's homepage during an internship at Syracuse University's Robotics Lab.
    I was only involved in the conceptual brainstorming step, however, so I'm excited to learn the actual programming side of it!</li>
  <li>My aspiration for the course is to learn HTML, CSS, and JS to a point where I can, if and when I want/need to, design and program a moderately complex website for any occasion that arises.</li>
  <li>I believe I've signed up for the Piazza forum; I can view the several discussion posts, so that must signify that I am signed up!</li>
  <li>While I'm not the most interesting individual (haha), I suppose an interesting fact about me is that I 've published a webtoon in the past as a hobby during my free time!
    Creating comics and writing storboards have been a passion of mine since childhood, and I'm actually working on an another series right now.</li>
</ul>
