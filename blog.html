    <h2>Post 1 (10/01/2020)</h2>

    <p>My greatest challenge in completing this assignment was managing time as a precious resource.
       having forced to delay my start of the term by a over a week due to the sudden and unexpected
       catastrophe, I needed to work much harder to catch up to the class as quickly as I could.
       Coding for Web Development, as expected, proved to be much different than conventional Python or
       C++ programming. Not any less interesting; in fact most aspects were fascinating, but introduction of so many new variables
       were difficult to absorb in such a rushed timeframe. This included learning the mechanisms of Git, Github,
       commmitting to master, etc., I wished that I was able to share the starting point with the rest
       of the class, but I did my very best with what I was given, like we all do.</p>

       <p>I think what I've learned the most is the structural process of coding in HTML, from setting up and
       running Visual Studio Code to the fundamentals of adding the basics to a webpage. Having hardly ever
       coded in a web-development setting throughout my coding journey, it was an engaging starting point.</p>

       <p>As cliche as it is, Youtube Tutorials proved to be the most helpful throughout my learning of fundamental HTML as well as
       setting up remote repository for the project. Simply put, I've used youtube tutorials to learn how to
       implement certain programming algorithms or concepts, so it was naturally where I went for help. It proved effective enough
       to help me progress at a satisfactory speed.</p>
       
    </p>

    <h2>Post 2 (10/26/2020)</h2>

    <p>My greatest challenge was the process of needing to reach a destination (the image of the completed site) with our own creativity and
      individual coding techniques. Sure, I've completed tasks such as "do this using this algorithm" in previous programming projects before,
      but I was forced to guess which css elements to even start with. This, I imagine, is largely due to my inability to be able to join 
      the course sessions for specific tips on approaching the assignment. Still, I did my best to replicate the looks of the mocks.
    </p>

    <p>Before beginning this assignment, the extent I knew about CSS was that there's a relationship between HTML and CSS, and not much more.
      I learned throughout experimenting with many different elements of CSS their ability to apply styles and orientations to the HTML elements.
      It got me that much more excited to see what javascript can do!
    </p>

    <p>Tutorials from w3schools were most helpful, because they provided example html and css codes that I could compare with the results for
      faster understanding. Overall, this assignment was most difficult because of the fact that I couldn't receive much directional cues on how
      to begin and work through it in order to reach the final result. Still, I did my very best!
    </p>

    <h2>Post 3 (11/16/2020)</h2>

    <p>For this project, the greatest challenge, which also proved to be the greatest excitement, was simply familizaring myself with the realm of
      javascript. Thankfully, it shared much similarity with languages such as C++ or Python, and it felt engaging to be able to
      partially connect my past programming knowledge to web development.
    </p>

    <P>Similar to my foundation on CSS prior to this course, I was simply aware of javascript's existence, nothing more. I discovered how
      functions can be interconnected with different html elements to perform a variety of different functions, even creating or deleting entire
      html elements from the webpage.
    </P>

    <p>I utilized several TA office hours, more than any of my past assignments without a doubt. It was very helpful to be able to
      connect with a person about my specific javascript questions. Since most of my questions were so specific to a situation, I prioritized
      speaking with a TA over blindingly attempting to find the answer online, as I knew that it'd be a difficult search.
      I even received help on the extra credit section, which I was very thankful for!
    </p>

    <h2>Post 4 (12/3/2020)</h2>

    <p>This assignment was very challenging; the concepts of handlebars, partials, helpers, node, and other related subjects confused me not only
      in the process of comprehending their essences, but their connections to each other through various interactions. I needed to re-read the
      lecture notes several times just to be able to reach a point where I feel like I can properly begin part 1 of this assignment.
    </p>

    <p>In return for its difficulty, I did learn just as much, if not more, than the previous assignment about javascript. Virtually no information
      was review; not only was I not aware of the existence of handlebars, but I was entirely oblivious to the aspect of server-side management or
      rendering. It was a bumpy but illuminating experience.
    </p>

    <p>As always, I've sought help via TAs often. However, I found it difficult to properly request specific aid or ask accurate questions at
      first, because I lacked the foundation to even properly install the libraries and even reach a point where I can locate a concrete error.
      It came down to my responsibility to figure out the fundamentals, and while it took longer than I'd have hoped, I still succeeded in
      having the server side up and running via node and express.
    </p>
