    <p>My greatest challenge in completing this assignment was managing time as a precious resource.
       having forced to delay my start of the term by a over a week due to the sudden and unexpected
       catastrophe, I needed to work much harder to catch up to the class as quickly as I could.
       Coding for Web Development, as expected, proved to be much different than conventional Python or
       C++ programming. Not any less interesting; in fact most aspects were fascinating, but introduction of so many new variables
       were difficult to absorb in such a rushed timeframe. This included learning the mechanisms of Git, Github,
       commmitting to master, etc., I wished that I was able to share the starting point with the rest
       of the class, but I did my very best with what I was given, like we all do.</p>

       <p>I think what I've learned the most is the structural process of coding in HTML, from setting up and
       running Visual Studio Code to the fundamentals of adding the basics to a webpage. Having hardly ever
       coded in a web-development setting throughout my coding journey, it was an engaging starting point.</p>

       <p>As cliche as it is, Youtube Tutorials proved to be the most helpful throughout my learning of fundamental HTML as well as
       setting up remote repository for the project. Simply put, I've used youtube tutorials to learn how to
       implement certain programming algorithms or concepts, so it was naturally where I went for help. It proved effective enough
       to help me progress at a satisfactory speed.</p>
